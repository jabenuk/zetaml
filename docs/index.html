		<h1>Welcome to the Official Zeta Maths Library Documentation</h1>

		<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
		Zetaml is suitable for any C/C++ project that requires more complex mathematical functions and objects such as matrices, vectors, etc. Keep in mind that I am developing this project mainly for my own use, so the features here are really just the features I need for my other project(s). This is a <i>personal project,</i> not a professional one. But I still try to put effort into its documentation.
		<br><br>
		All code related to zetaml is open-source and free; see the source repository <a href="https://github.com/jabenuk/zetamlc">here</a>.

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		Zetaml is built with <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
		<br><br>
		When compiling, use the <code>-DZML_USE_FLOATS</code> flag to use <b>floats</b> (32-bit floating values) instead of <b>doubles</b> (64-bit floating values). You can also use the <code>-DZML_BUILD_TESTS</code> flag to build test executable(s); this can be useful if you intend to help develop zetaml. Furthermore, you can use the <code>i386-linux-gnu.cmake</code> toolchain file to build for 32-bit with GCC - as zetaml aims to be as compatible as possible with early architectures, I recommend testing the project on both x86 and x86_64 architectures if you contribute at all.
		<br><br>
		To use the library, include <code>&lt;zetamlc.h&gt;</code>.

		<h2 id="configuring-zetaml">Configuring zetaml</h2>

		<h3 id="zmlSetLibFlag"><code>void zmlSetLibFlag(unsigned int flag, unsigned char val)</code></h3>
		You can use this function to configure the library. <b>All flags are false by default!</b>
		<ul>
			<li><code>flag</code> the flag to set (see below).</li>
			<li><code>val</code> the boolean value to set to the flag.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="flags">Available flags</h3>
		Not to be confused with the available <b>compilation flags</b>, which are <code>-DZML_USE_FLOATS</code> and <code>-DZML_BUILD_TESTS</code>. The flags in the following table are enabled with the <a href="#zmlSetLibFlag">zmlSetLibFlag()</a> at <b>runtime</b>.
		<br><br>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Flag</th>
				<th>Description</th>
				<th>Additional notes</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>ZML_USE_DEGREES</code></td>
				<td>Use degrees instead of radians.</td>
				<td>Radians are used by default.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>ZML_USE_LEFT_COORDS</code></td>
				<td>Use left-handed coordinates instead of the default right-handed coordinates.</td>
				<td>By convention, OpenGL uses right-handed coordinates, and DirectX uses left-handed coordinates. Zetaml uses right-handed by default.</td>
			</tr>
