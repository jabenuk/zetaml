# zetamlc: a lightweight general-purpose maths library.

_This readme is **unfinished**. It will be added to as development goes on._

## Summary
zetamlc is a C port of the original [Zeta Maths Library](https://github.com/jabenuk/zetaml) for C++.

zetamlc is suitable for any C/C++ project that requires more complex math functions and objects such as matrices, vectors, etc.
