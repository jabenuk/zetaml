# zetamlc: the Zeta Maths Library for C

_This readme is **unfinished**. It will be added to as development goes on._

## Summary
zetamlc is a C port of the original [Zeta Maths Library](https://github.com/jabenuk/zetaml) for C++.

zetamlc is suitable for any C/C++ project that requires more complex math functions and objects such as matrices, vectors, etc.

| :warning: Keep in mind: I'm designing this for my own use so it may be limited for uses outside of what I'm using it for (which is rendering with OpenGL). |
